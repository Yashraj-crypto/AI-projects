# AI-projects
Here are some basic starter projects:
1. Handwritten digit recognition using mnist dataset
2. Image classification on Cifar 10 dataset
3. Linear regression for housing price prediction
4. Denoising autoencoders on mnist dataset

These projects use Python as the main language.
Libraries such as [Tensorflow/Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) which helps build and train AI models easily and are crucial in learning basic concepts.
